# Vue task manager

A web application you can use to remember your activities. This is an amateur project created for entertainment
purposes.

Project uses [lilac.js](https://github.com/vladsdamnmemory/lilac) which is used as a Vue plugin.

The application code style is pretty loose and doesn't pretend to be perfect.
`Vue task manager` is currently being gradually developed as a freestyled side project.
