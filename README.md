Yes, I know BEM is presented not everywhere due to will to make more visible functionality rather than inner style clarity
Styles need refactoring because I wanted to implement as much as I can in a fastest way
While developing there was no designer involved =)
That is what I had time to make out this weekends
Chrome is more preferable for check due to limited development time, Safari spoils the font
Please note that I have not written for a long time on Vue (2 or more years)
